#✨ Credits & Acknowledgements
This project is originally inspired by the awesome Pac-Man Java Game Tutorial by Ken Yip Coding on YouTube. I followed the base tutorial to learn how the game engine works in Java using JPanel, KeyListener, and Timer.

After building the base version, I extended the project by adding several custom features on my own:

🔧 Features I Added:
✅ Pause and Resume functionality (P key toggles pause)

✅ High Score Saving using highscore.txt file

✅ Wrap-Around Maze: Pac-Man exits one side and re-enters from the opposite side

✅ Game Over Reset on key release

🚧 (Upcoming): Cherry Power-Up, Ghost Fright Mode

These additions helped me explore file I/O, game logic, and interactive UI updates in Java.

Special thanks to Ken Yip for making such a helpful and beginner-friendly tutorial!
